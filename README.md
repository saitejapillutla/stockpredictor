# stockpredictorApplication The project mainly focuses on an Application that uses Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and especially Long-Short Term Memory Models (LSTM) to determine future stock market values.

the main aim is to see how accurately a machine learning algorithm is able to predict and with such a precision that user can receive best possible prediction through
the application from our model. an android app using kotlin programming language which lets us take full advantage of async using coroutines which lets me have utmost supremacy while scheduling jobs for each thread and maintains fluidity while the app takes data from API to display the current market status and specific dayâ€™s stock trends.

Google firebase console is used to deploy and manage application data and custom models.Google colab is used to create custom designed and executable models to make predictions. RapidAPI platform is used to acquire keys and manage NSE API data and requests. Koltin courtines libraries are used to smoothly implement the carryout of the above cloud and network calls inside the application.

As stock trading has been growing rapidly becoming competitive among the society, my application has met its objectives and purposes of the implementing it, as make it successful run in analysis of application tracking, ml model remote implementations and next day stock price predictions which makes the users a bit nearer in taking better decisions while investing.
